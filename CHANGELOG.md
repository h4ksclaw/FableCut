# Changelog

All notable changes to FableCut are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Direct manipulation on the program monitor** — click a clip or title on the
  preview to select it, then drag the body to move, the corner handles to resize,
  and the top handle to rotate (hold Shift to snap rotation to 15°). Gestures map
  straight onto the clip's `x`/`y`/`scale`/`rotation` props. Selection handles are
  drawn only on screen and never appear in an export.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Title styles** — text clips no longer all look the same. Adding a title now
  rotates through curated one-tap looks (Impact, Elegant, Kinetic cut, Neon,
  Handwritten, Serif drop, Subtitle, Bold rise), each bundling a **different
  font**, placement and animation. Pick or shuffle them from the inspector, or
  reproduce any look from an agent by writing the same props.
- **Four cinematic caption animations**: `clip-reveal` (wipe-mask sweep),
  `zoom-in` (scale + opacity settle), `font-cut` (rhythmically swaps the typeface
  from a `fontCutSet`, then settles), and `rise-mask` (lower-third reveal). All
  render on the existing frame-accurate path, so they export unchanged.
- Expanded the built-in Google-font list with the display faces the styles use
  (Archivo Black, Abril Fatface, Barlow, Teko, Roboto). Any font name still
  auto-downloads on demand.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-11

### Security

Hardening of the local server against network and drive-by attacks, prompted by
the report in [#1](https://github.com/ronak-create/FableCut/issues/1) — thanks
@suthakamal2.

- The server now binds **127.0.0.1 only** by default (previously all
  interfaces, reachable from the whole LAN). Deliberate LAN use is an explicit
  opt-in: `HOST=0.0.0.0 node server.js` plus
  `FABLECUT_ALLOWED_HOSTS=192.168.1.20,mybox.local`.
- Every request is checked against a **Host-header allowlist**
  (localhost/127.0.0.1/[::1] + the opt-ins above), which defeats DNS-rebinding
  attacks, and — when the browser sends one — an **Origin allowlist**, which
  defeats blind cross-origin writes from malicious web pages (e.g. a drive-by
  `POST /api/upload` carried a no-preflight raw body).
- The static file server no longer serves dot-files or dot-directories
  (`.git/`, `.gitignore`, …), and both path-traversal guards now use
  separator-anchored directory prefixes.

### Added
- The default asset library now ships with the repo where licensing allows:
  20 Google Fonts in `library/fonts/` (OFL, listed in `LICENSES.md`) and the
  self-authored overlay SVGs in `library/elements/`. `library/sfx/` stays
  local-only (SFX-site licenses generally prohibit redistribution) — its new
  README points to good free sources.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Reference-remake pipeline** — give FableCut a reference video and get back an
  *edit blueprint* to rebuild the same idea with different footage over the same
  music. New zero-dependency analyzer (`analyze.js`, needs ffmpeg): shot-boundary
  detection with adaptive threshold, music beat + BPM detection (onset envelope +
  autocorrelation, span-refined), a 0.5 s loudness curve, per-shot audio energy,
  drop detection, and extraction of the reference's music track into `media/`.
  Exposed as MCP tool `fablecut_analyze_reference`, REST `POST /api/analyze`
  (cached under `./analysis/`, `GET /api/analyze?src=…`), and CLI
  `node analyze.js <video>`. New CLAUDE.md section "Remake a reference video"
  documents the blueprint schema and the rebuild recipe.
- **Token-efficient agent surface**:
  - `fablecut_patch_project` — targeted ops (`addClip`, `updateClip`,
    `removeClip`, `addMedia`, `removeMedia`, `setProject`) applied to the latest
    on-disk document in one atomic, merge-safe write — no more round-tripping the
    whole project JSON for a one-prop change.
  - `fablecut_get_project {compact:true}` — one-line-per-clip timeline summary
    (non-default props only, keyframe/transition digests), ~10× smaller.
  - `fablecut_docs {section:"…"}` — fetch only matching `## ` sections of the manual.
  - `fablecut_status` now caps long media listings.
  - New CLAUDE.md section "Token-efficient editing" with agent guidance.

### Changed
- Full `fablecut_get_project` now returns minified JSON (was pretty-printed).
- MCP server bumped to version **1.3.0**.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Timeline multi-select** — rubber-band marquee (drag on empty track area)
  selects every clip the box touches. Ctrl/Cmd/Shift+click adds or removes
  individual clips. Ctrl+A selects all; Esc deselects.
- **Group move** — dragging any selected clip moves the whole selection by the
  same time delta (clamped at 0). Vertical track moves remain per-clip.
- **Batch Delete / Split** — Delete removes all selected clips; S splits every
  selected clip that sits under the playhead.
- **Multi-select inspector** — shows an "N clips selected" banner; edits the
  primary (white-outlined) clip; secondary clips show a lighter outline.
- **Conflict-safe `PUT /api/project`** — rejects stale writes with **409** when
  the request body's `revision` ≤ the on-disk revision; response body is
  `{error, revision}` with the current value. Append `?force=1` to overwrite
  deliberately. Writes are now atomic (tmp file + rename).
- **Conflict-safe MCP `fablecut_set_project`** — tracks the revision from the
  last `fablecut_get_project` and errors with "CONFLICT — not saved" if
  `project.json` changed on disk since that read. Recovery: re-read, re-apply,
  save. New optional `force: true` argument bypasses the check.

### Changed
- Editor UI syncs by exact revision comparison (no timing heuristics); detects
  external changes even during the previous 1.5 s blind window; defers reloads
  during drag/export and applies them immediately after; preserves clip
  selection across external reloads (pruned to clips that still exist); shows a
  toast ("Project was updated externally…") when an external write supersedes an
  unsaved local tweak.
- Selection state survives undo/redo.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` updated to document all of the above.
- MCP server bumped to version **1.2.0**.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Motion FX** (all animatable): camera `shake` / `shakeSpeed`, `rgbSplit`
  chromatic aberration, and boiling film `grain`.
- **Speed ramps** — `speed` is now keyframable. The engine time-remaps media time
  as `in + ∫ speed dt` in both preview and the offline export audio mix (the
  fast-into-slow-motion reel move).
- **Adjustment layers** — a new `kind:"adjust"` clip that re-renders everything
  drawn below it through its own grade/filter/shake/grain/vignette stack,
  Premiere-style. Added the *+ Adjust* button, inspector, and timeline styling.
- **Neon caption glow** (`glow` / `glowColor`).
- Four new kinetic text animations: `letter-pop`, `wave`, `bounce`, `shake`.
- Two new transitions: `glitch` (RGB split + jitter) and `pop` (overshoot scale).
- Project-level `background` color, persisted and drawn behind all clips.
- 16 new animated library SVGs (subscribe pill/bell, rating stars, arrows,
  badges, progress/loading bars, speech bubble, hearts, equalizer, pulses…).

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` expanded to document all of the above.
- MCP server validation now exempts `adjust` clips from the `mediaId` check.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Initial public release: a zero-dependency, Premiere-style browser video editor
  whose entire timeline is a single `project.json` document.
- **Editing** — 4 video + 3 audio tracks, drag/trim/split/snap, undo/redo, beat &
  cue markers, real decoded audio waveforms, aspect presets + safe-area guides.
- **Look** — 12 filter presets, full grade controls (temperature/tint/vignette),
  blend modes, fit/crop/corner-radius/flip, chroma key, in-browser AI background
  removal (MediaPipe).
- **Motion** — keyframe animation with easing, per-clip speed, 15 transitions.
- **Text** — kinetic captions, gradient/outline/pill styling, any Google Font by
  name, drop-in custom fonts.
- **Animated SVG clips** — a first-class `svg` kind rendered frame-accurately from
  CSS `@keyframes`.
- **Export** — fast browser-rendered frames + offline audio mix encoded by ffmpeg
  (CRF-18 MP4), with a realtime MediaRecorder fallback.
- Three control surfaces for AI agents: **MCP server**, direct `project.json`
  editing, and a **REST API** with live-reload over server-sent events.
